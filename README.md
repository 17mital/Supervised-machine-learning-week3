📚 Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification - Week 3

Welcome to Week 3! 🚀 This repository contains my Week 3 Open Lab Jupyter Notebooks from the Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification course, part of Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

📌 Course Overview

This week focuses on classification techniques, particularly logistic regression. It also covers overfitting and introduces regularization as a method to improve model generalization.

Key topics covered:

Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

Cost Function for Logistic Regression

Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression

Overfitting and Regularization

Implementing Logistic Regression with Scikit-learn
